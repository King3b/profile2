            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Blessings Marera, a 19-year-old IT student with a strong passion for programming. I've always been fascinated by how code can solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life. I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to master different programming languages and technologies. In 10 years, I see myself as a lead software engineer, driving impactful projects and helping shape the future of tech. I'm especially excited about creating software solutions that make a difference and mentoring others along the way. I'm eager to contribute, learn, and grow in a dynamic team like yours.</p>
